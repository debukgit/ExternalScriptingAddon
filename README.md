# Simple External Scripting Addon
A small addon for running an externally edited python file from with blender easily

#Usage:
1. Make sure your blendfile has already saved to disk to have a valid directory and filename
2. Create a defaultscript.py placed to the same folder like your blend file and script in this file instead of the internal editor.
2. Run the addon from File-Defaults-RunDefaultScript or via search or define a hotkey if you like
